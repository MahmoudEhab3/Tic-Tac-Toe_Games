# C++ OOP Board Games

This repository contains implementations of three popular board games: Pyramid XO, Connect 4, and 5x5 XO. Each game is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++. 

## Games Description

### Pyramid XO
Pyramid XO is a variant of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe, played on a pyramid-shaped board. The game's objective is to align your symbols vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent.

### Connect 4
Connect 4 is a well-known two-player connection game in which the players take turns playing from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

### 5x5 XO
5x5 XO expands the traditional 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe grid to a 5x5 board, increasing the complexity and strategy of the game. The goal is to line up five of your symbols in a row, which can be challenging given the larger play area.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Each game is implemented with classes representing the game board, players, and the main game logic.
- **Extensibility**: The codebase is designed to be easily extensible for adding new game features or rules.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Written in standard C++, making the games compatible with multiple operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.
